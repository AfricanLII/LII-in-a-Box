Proviso (a), on the other hand, has no counterpart in English law.  It was introduced into South African law by the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act, 1917.  Its general effect is that confessions made to members of the police force who are not just

e and the threat of further assaults.  The policemen concerned denied this, but two women called as witnesses by the defence said that they had seen the police assaulting the accused.  At the end of the evidence the court concluded unanimously that while 
they were not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the statements had been freely and voluntarily made, the accused had failed to discharge the onus upon them under proviso (b) on a balance of probabilities.  In his judgment, given on 10}{

The Attorney-General of Natal submits in his supporting affidavit that if the matter is sent back to the trial court without our deciding the issue it would have to be referred again to this Court at the end of the trial.  More important, he informs 
us that prevailing unc
ertainty as to the constitutionality of section 217(1)(b)(ii) has resulted in inconsistency in practice in Natal and elsewhere in the Republic.  That uncertainty would remain unresolved until a suitable case came properly before this Court.  We agree with
 the Attorney-General of Natal and with Mr d'Oliviera SC, the Attorney-General of the Transvaal, who appeared for the State that this state of affairs must seriously prejudice the general administration of justice as well as the interests of the numerous 
ac
cused persons affected.  The admissibility of confessions is a question which arises daily in our criminal courts and prolonged uncertainty would be quite unacceptable.  As appears from the terms of Rule 17, direct access is contemplated in only the most 
exceptional cases, and it is certainly not intended to be used to legitimate an incompetent reference.  But in the special circumstances set out in the affidavit the application under rule 17 was fully justified.  Mr. McNally's application is accordingly 
granted, so that the question of the validity of section 217(1)(b)(ii) is properly before this Court.

The concepts embodied in these provisions are by no means an entirely new departure in South African criminal procedure.  The presumption of innocence, the right of silence and the proscription of compelled confessions have for 150 years or more been reco
gnised as basic principles of our law, although all of them have to a greater or lesser degree been eroded by statute and in some cases by judicial decision.  The resulting body of common law and statute law forms part of
 the background to section 25.  The provisions of section 25 are more specific than many of the other provisions of Chapter 3.  They do nonetheless give rise to problems of interpretation.

He adds on the same page that the Constitution must be interpreted so as "to give clear expression to the values it seeks to nurture for a future South Africa."  This is undoubtedly true.  South African Courts are indeed enjoined by section 35 of the Cons
titution to interpret Chapter 3 so as  "to promote the values which underlie an open
 and democratic society based on freedom and equality", and, where applicable, to have regard to relevant public international law.  That section also permits our courts to have regard to comparable foreign case law.
\par I am, however, sure that Froneman J, in his reference to the fundamental "mischief" to be remedied, did not intend to say that all the principles of law which have hitherto governed our courts are to be ignored.  Those principles obviously contain much of
 lasting value.  Nor, I am equally sure,
 did the learned judge intend to suggest that we should neglect the language of the Constitution.  While we must always be conscious of the values underlying the Constitution, it is nonetheless our task to interpret a written instrument.   I am well aware
 of the fallacy of supposing that general language must have a single "objective" meaning.  Nor is it easy to avoid the influence of one's personal intellectual and moral preconceptions.  But it cannot be too strongly stressed that the Constitution does n
ot mean whatever we might wish it to mean.

As pointed out above, section 217(1)(b)(ii) creates a legal presumption, with the legal burden of rebuttal on the accused - what has been called a "reverse onus".  The legitimacy of such provisions has been considered by courts as varied as the Unite
d States Supreme Court, The Canadian Supreme Court, the Privy Council and the European Court of Human Rights (and doubtless others) in the light of provisions entrenching, in varying language, the presumption of innocence, the right to silence and the pri
v
ilege against self-incrimination - a privilege not expressly referred to in section 25.   The case law of these courts - which are undoubtedly courts of open and democratic societies - indicates that reverse onus provisions are by no means uncommon and ar
e not necessarily unconstitutional.  Reverse onus provisions in our own statute law are also not uncommon.  To go no further than the Criminal Procedure Act one finds, for example, the presumptions arising from entries in marriage registers on charges of 
bi
gamy (section 237), the presumption of knowledge of falsity arising from proof of a factually false representation (section 245) and the presumption of having failed to pay tax arising merely from an allegation in a charge sheet (section 249).  Foreign co
urts have grappled with the problem of reconciling presumptions reversing the onus of proof with the constitutional presumption of innocence.  The different solutions which they have suggested are illuminating.

The "rational connection" test has been considered in the substantial jurisprudence which the Canadian courts have developed in construing their Charter of Rights.  The Canadian cases on reverse onus prov
isions seem to me to be particularly helpful, not only because of their persuasive reasoning, but because section 1 of the Charter has a limitation clause analogous to section 33 of the South African Constitution.  This calls for a "two-stage" approach.  
First, has there been a contravention of a guaranteed right?  If so, is it justified under the limitation clause?   The single stage approach (as in the US Constitution or the Hong Kong Bill of Rights) may call for a more flexible approach to the construc
tion of the fundamental right, whereas the two-stage approach may call for a broader interpretation of the fundamental right, qualified only at the second stage.   In }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001

The short answer to this argument is that the distinction between elements of the offence and other aspects of the charge is irrelevant to the s. 11(d) inquiry.  The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but 
that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable doubt exists.  When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the presumption of innocence.

  The judgment of Cory J at 456 contains a useful analysis of different types of presumption.   The type with which we are concerned in section 217(1)(b)(ii) is described as a legal presumption "where the presumed fact must be disproved on a balance of pr
obabilities instead of by the mere raising of evidence to the contrary".   This is what the Canadian courts refer to as a "reverse onus" clause, as I do in this judgment.

Does the application of these principles in itself demonstrate a violation of the presumption of innocence in section 217(1)(b)(ii)?   Mr d'Oliviera for the State contended that it did not.  The admission of a confession, he said, did not conclude th
e prosecution in favour of the State.  Thus in the present case further evidence might entitle the trial court in this case to review its finding that the accused had not discharged th
e onus on them.  There might also be evidence which would lead a court to find that a confession, although admissible, was untrue.  Moreover, the presumption did not relate to any element of the offence charged, but merely to the voluntary character of th

 evidence, it is, as I shall show, a rule which lies at the heart of important rights embodied in section 25, including the right to remain silent after arr

The conclusion which I reach, as a result of this survey, is that the common law rule in regard to the burden of proving that a confession was voluntary has been not a fortuitous but an integral and essential part of the right to remain silent after 
arrest, the right not to be compelled to make a confession, and the right not to be a compellable witness against oneself.  These rights, in turn, are the necessary reinforcement of Viscount Sankey's "golden thread" - that it is for th
e prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt (}{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 Woolmington's case, supra)}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 
.  Reverse the burden of proof and all these rights are seriously compromised and undermined.  I therefore consider that the common law rule on the burden of proof is inherent in the rights specifically mentioned in section 25(2) and (3)(c) and (d), and f
orms part of the right to a fair trial.   In so interpreting these provisions of the Constitution I have taken account of the historical background, and compa
rable  foreign case law.  I believe too that this interpretation promotes the values which underlie an open and democratic society and is entirely consistent with the language of section 25.  It follows that section 217(1)(b)(ii) violates these provisions
 of the Constitution.

The Canadian courts have evolved certain criteria, in applying this section, such as the existence of substantial and pressing public needs which are met by the impugned statute. There, if the statutory violation is to be justified it must also pass a "pr
oportionality" test, which the courts dissect into several components.   See, e.g. }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 R v Chaulk }{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 (1991)}{

on, in this case at least, to attempt to fit our analysis into the Canadian pattern.

probable that a magistrate would take a confession from someone unless he is convinced of the existence of the prescribed requirements for the admissibility thereof.  In view of these considerations, and to give meaning to the making or confirmation of a 
confession to or in the presence of a magistrate, the Commission is of the opinion that, where a confession was made to a magistrate and reduced to writing, or confirmed and reduced to writing in the presence of a magistrate, it should at the trial of tha
t 
person for an offence to which the confession relates, be presumed, unless that person proved the contrary (that is to say, on a balance of probabilities) that the confession was made freely and voluntarily by such person in his sound and sober senses wit
hout having been unduly influenced thereto.  The Commission therefore recommends that a further proviso to this effect be added to section 244(1) with reference to a confession made to a magistrate or confirmed and reduced to writing in the presence of a 
magistrate.  Such a provision would considerably shorten and may eliminate the extent of the so called trials within a trial."

It appears from this passage that the harm which the new proviso was intended to overcome was twofold.  First, some accused attempt dishonestly to retract confessions which they have made before a magistrate.  Second, this leads to unduly long trials with

As to the first head of justification, the objective is laudable.  But the reasoning of the Commission seems to overlook the interests of an accused who has in fact been subject to duress.  The Commission itself, in para 5.23 of its Report, recognise
d that an apparently voluntary confirmation of a confession before a magistrate "may be misleading, where the confession was in fact forced beforehand by improper interrogation or induceme
nt by the police."  There is nothing before this Court to show that the common law rule caused substantial harm to the administration of justice.  The Commission points to the improbability of a magistrate taking a confession unless convinced of its volun
tariness.   That may well be an improbability in most cases, but why that should justify placing a burden of proof on the accused I am unable to follow.  That improbability has always weighed  against an accused and will continue to do so, without resort 
to
 the proviso.  In any event there is nothing in the Criminal Procedure Act which obliges a magistrate to conduct any particular preliminary enquiry into voluntariness.  Some Attorneys-General and magistrates have drafted helpful questionnaires for the use
 of magistrates or justices of the peace before recording a confession.  But there is no standard form and none with statutory provenance.

The reverse onus may in some cases obviate or shorten the trial within a trial.  Those of my colleagues on the C
ourt who have had  considerable experience of criminal trials doubt that is so.  Even if it were the case, and even if it did release police or prosecution from the inconvenience of marshalling and calling their witnesses before the accused gave evidence,
 I cannot regard those inconveniences as outweighing and justifying the substantial infringement of the important rights which I have identified.  The argument from convenience would only have merit in situations where accused persons plainly have more co
nvenient access to proof, and where the reversed burden does not create undue hardship or unfairness.   }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 Cf R v Oakes}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001

 decide.  It does not decide that all statutory provisions which create presumptions in criminal cases are invalid.  This Court recognises the pressing social need for the effective prosecution of crime, and that in some cases the prosecution may require 
reasonable presumptions to assist it in this task.  Presumptions are of different types.  Some are no more than evidential presumptions, which give certain prosecution evidence the status of }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 
prima facie}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001  proof, requiring the accused to do no more than produce credible evidence which casts doubt on the }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 prima facie}{
\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 
 proof.  See e.g. the presumptions in section 212 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  This judgment does not relate to such presumptions.   Nor does it seek to invalidate every legal presumption reversing the onus of proof.  Some may be justifiable as being r
ational in themselves, requiring an accused
 person to prove only facts to which he or she has easy access, and which it would be unreasonable to expect the prosecution to disprove.   The provisions in section 237 of the Act (evidence on charge of bigamy) may be of this type.  Or there may be presu
mptions which are necessary if certain offences are to be effectively prosecuted, and the State is able to show that for good reason it cannot be expected to produce the evidence itself.  The presumption that a person who habitually consorts with prostitu
tes is living off the proceeds of prostitution was upheld on that basis in }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 R v Downey supra}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001

I would also make clear that this judgment does not purport to apply to exceptions, exemptions or provisos to statutory offences, referred to in section 90 of the Criminal Procedure Act and in the extensive case law on that section and its predecesso

Paragraph (a) of the sub-section applies in this case.  Absent a specific order by this Court, any decision by a trial court admitting a confession in reliance on section 217(1)(b)(ii), given before the 
date of the declaration of its invalidity, would stand.  This would be unfortunate for some accused persons.  But if we were to give our declaration full retrospective effect in terms of section 98(6) so as to invalidate such earlier rulings on admissibil
ity the likely result of such order would be numerous appeals with the possibility of proceedings }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 de novo}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 
 under sections 313 or 324 of the Criminal Procedure Act. In proceedings }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 de novo }{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 
the necessary evidence of voluntariness may no longer be available.  Pa
ragraph (a) of section 98(6) is intended to ensure that the invalidation of a statute existing at the date of commencement of the Constitution should not ordinarily have any retrospective effect, so as to avoid the dislocation and inconvenience of undoing
 transactions, decisions or actions taken under that statute.  This Court's power to order otherwise in the interests of justice and good government should be exercised circumspectly.  In some cases (and I believe that this is one of them) the interests o
f 
individuals must be weighed against the interest of avoiding dislocation to the administration of justice and the desirability of a smooth transition from the old to the new. We should also take into account the fact that hitherto the police and prosecuti
on have legitimately relied on section 217(1)(b)(ii).  Cf. the approach of the United States Supreme Court in such cases as }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 Linkletter v Walker}{\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001

April, 1994 may well have caused injustice to accused persons, but we cannot repair all past injustice by a simple stroke of the pen.  Weighing all the relevant considerations it seems to me that the proper balance can be struck by invalidating the admiss

als to require reconsideration of the admissibility of confessions already admitted, including the hearing of further evidence.   Whether an order under section 98(6) may or should encompass proceedings which were pending before 27th April, 1994, depends 
on the proper interpretation of section 241(8) of the Constitution.  As indicated at the beginning of the judgment, that issue is deferred for determination in the }{\i\fs24\lang2057\langfe1033\langnp2057\insrsid13313001 Mhlungu}{
